### Prerequisites:
  * Docker
  * Docker-compose
  * And probably a Linux-based OS
  
### How to start your Phoenix server.
Simply run one of the following commands:

Choose `docker-compose up` if you want to see the log output in your terminal.

Choose `docker-compose up -d` if you don't want to see any output.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Your code changes are hot-reloaded, so any changes should now be automatically updated on the Phoenix server.
